## Notes

- [ ] >**UPDATE 17/11:**
	I'm going to remove the card component and just render everything in a big screen, I will try to position the tab menu mid-way on the screen, but if that doesn't work then I'm going to change the design to be at the top
- [ ] I want to render tabs and other elements on a card -> so that way I can overlay the entire component on top of a map, but I have a few problems:
	- Tab view doesn't seem to work properly ontop of other elements, it only seems to work when you only have the screen so anything can cover it
	- I don't know how I would go about overlaying this component on top of a map
- [ ] My options for tab view:
	- Do away with the card component and render everything on multiple screens
	- Somehow manage to wrangle tab view to work with a card
- [ ] UPDATE: Scrollview really does not want to work with tab view, so here are my options:
	1. Easiest, also most dodgy: Just make everything fit on one screen so you don't have to scroll
	2. Redesign the location detail page so that tabs are positioned at the very top and go from there
	3. Really big overhaul of the design to try and accomodate for scrolling (least preferable)
