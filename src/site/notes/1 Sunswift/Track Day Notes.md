### Grafana Fixes
- Solar current drops in/out
- Need to double check odometer -> was changing units strangely on track day
- Fix GPS maps to prevent data point bloat -> limits were an issue
- Fastest speed per lap doesn't really work
- Perms got removed

### Personal
- Need to become more familiar with Grafana boards + the whole telemetry set up for Sunswift
- Getting data is really important -> need to ensure that data is consistently appearing on Grafana at all times, reliably
- There are a lot of refinements/refactoring to the code that would be more beneficial to SR7 and telemetry as opposed to working on a mobile app
