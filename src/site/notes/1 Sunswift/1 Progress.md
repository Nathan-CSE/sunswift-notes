## In Progress

- [ ] Sketch out the system design + cloud architecture diagram #MobileApp
- [ ] Experiment with tailwind/random frameworks for data visualisation #MobileApp


## Completed

- [x] Figure out what frameworks/libraries we want to use, what would let us visualise the data? 3D models of the vehicle? #MobileApp
- [x] figure out staging for model -> proper orientation for model + small rotation #MobileApp
- [x] Come up with MVP requirements + features that would be implemented in the app #MobileApp
- [x] Create basic app with React Native + render 3d model #MobileApp


## Mobile App

- [ ] Create the UI/UX in Figma -> what should be displayed on the app #MobileApp
- [ ] Experiment with Google maps API integration on app #MobileApp
- [ ] Figure out getting data from Grafana -> what would be useful, what is the data presented in?^[tharun is working on this] #MobileApp
- [ ] Research into ROSCube? How to connect to central computer for remote vehicle? #MobileApp
- [ ] consider additional requirements for the app -> potential kiosk or showcase mode? similar to part visualiser on figma? #MobileApp


## Grafana

- [ ] Solar current drops in/out #Grafana
- [ ] Need to double check odometer -> was changing units strangely on track day #Grafana
- [ ] Fix GPS maps to prevent data point bloat -> limits were an issue #Grafana
- [ ] Fastest speed per lap doesn't really work #Grafana
- [ ] Perms keep getting removed #Grafana
- [ ] Random positive/negative velocities? #Grafana
- [ ] Measure latency on Grafana ([latency view?](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/16118-latency-view/)) #Grafana


## General Telemetry

- [ ] Watch AWS presentation + draw diagrams for notes #Telemetry
- [ ] Read through sunswift documentation to get an understanding of the cloud architecture + different AWS services #Telemetry
- [ ] [[1 Sunswift/Telemetry Notes/GitHub Wiki Notes#Potential Issues and Improvements\|List of Improvements]] #Telemetry
